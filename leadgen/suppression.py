"""
Competitor suppression — find businesses that are ALREADY a competitor's client,
so we don't waste a call on them. This is the core of SimplyTC's "don't call
brokerages already using another TC company" requirement (DESIGN.md §5.1), but
it's written generically: any vertical with competitors that publish client lists
can use it.

How it works: competitors love to brag. TC companies (and most B2B service firms)
publish testimonial pages, "clients we serve", and client-logo walls. We fetch
those pages and extract the named clients, then the pipeline sinks any lead whose
normalized name matches.
